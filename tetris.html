                 In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and sides 
                 walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the 
                 screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it 
                 in play. How long can you keep the ball alive?</p></div>
